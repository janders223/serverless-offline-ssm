# serverless-offline-ssm
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/janders223/serverless-offline-ssm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/janders223/serverless-offline-ssm)

This [Serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) plugin allows you to develop offline while using AWS SSM parameters in your `serverless.yml` template. The plugin looks for environment variables which are fulfilled by SSM parameters at build time and substitutes them from a `.env` file when running locally with the [serverless-offline plugin](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline).

## Installation

First install the plugins using npm or yarn

```bash
npm install serverless-offline serverless-offline-ssm --save-dev

#or

yarn add -D serverless-offline serverless-offline-ssm
```

Then inside of your project's `serverless.yml` file add the following to the plugins section. Note it is important that `serverless-offline-ssm` is loaded before `serverless-offline`. This is important to ensure that we are setting the variables properly for `serverless-offline` before it needs them.

_NOTE:_ It is imperative that `serverless-offline-ssm` be the the first plugin listed in the plugins section of your `serverless.yml` file. Due to the load order of plugins, other plugins may interfere with the loading of your `.env` file.

```yaml
plugins:
    - serverless-offline-ssm
    - serverless-offline
```
